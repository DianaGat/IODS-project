# About the project

The course seems to be very friendly to people from other spheres. I especially liked this. My background is International Relations and now I am interested in statistics. During the first lecture the assistant teacher Elina motivated me a lot as she has similar background and now succeed with data science :). 
  The teaching team is very friendly and positive. All together it makes me feel interested in the course and I expect it will be enjoyable.
